## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a structured Risk Register and risk governance model for SentraNova AI Solutions, a fictional AI company.

The register aligns with ISO 27001 risk management principles and reflects real-world GRC practices, including risk appetite definition, escalation criteria, residual risk tracking, and executive-level reporting.

All data in this project is fictional and used solely for demonstration purposes.

- Risk-based decision making

- Control prioritization
